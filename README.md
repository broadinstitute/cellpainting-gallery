# Cell Painting Gallery

This page provides a guide to the datasets that are available in the Cell Painting Gallery, hosted by the AWS Registry of Open Data (RODA): <https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery>

## Citation/license

All the data is released with CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0).
Still, professional ethics require that you cite the appropriate resources/publications, [listed below](#available-datasets), when using individual datasets.
For example,

> We used the dataset `cpg0000` ([Chandrasekaran et al., 2022a](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.05.475090)), available from the Cell Painting Gallery on the Registry of Open Data on AWS (<https://registry.opendata.aws/cellpainting-gallery/>).

## Available datasets

All datasets are generated using the Cell Painting assay unless indicated otherwise. Several updates to that protocol exist ([Cell Painting wiki](https://github.com/carpenterlab/2022_Cimini_NatureProtocols/wiki)).

The datasets are stored with the prefix indicated by the dataset name.
E.g. the first dataset is located at `s3://cellpainting-gallery/cpg0000-jump-pilot` and can be listed using `aws s3 ls --no-sign-request s3://cellpainting-gallery/cpg0000-jump-pilot/` (note the `/` at the end).

The datasets' accession numbers are the first seven characters of the dataset name.
E.g. the accession number of the first dataset is `cpg0000`.

## Downloading from Cell Painting Gallery

See [Folder Structure](folder_structure.md) for a complete description of data organization in Cell Painting gallery.
Note that for each dataset you can download just images, just extracted features and metadata, or both.
Note also that many datasets contain separate batches and you may want a subset of available batches.

If you'd like to just browse the data, it's a lot easier [to do so using a storage browser](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72143198/1094109).
