# Cell Painting Gallery Overview

The Cell Painting Gallery is a publicly available collection of Cell Painting datasets, curated by the Imaging Platform at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS) on the Registry of Open Data (RODA).
**Access does not require an AWS account**.

## Available datasets

Complete datasets with descriptive overview are listed [here](complete_datasets.md).
Prefixes for datasets-in-progress can be accessed [here](prefixes.md).
Most prefixes within the Cell Painting Gallery are for unique Cell Painting datasets that contain images, extracted features, and metadata.
However, some prefixes are re-analyses of other datasets and may not contain images.

## Downloading from Cell Painting Gallery

See [Data Structure](data_structure.md) for a complete description of data organization in the Cell Painting Gallery.
Note that for each dataset you can download just images, just extracted features and metadata, or both.
Note also that many datasets contain multiple batches and you may want a subset of available batches.

We provide detailed information on how to list/browse the Cell Painting Gallery [here](browsing_data.md) and download from the Cell Painting Gallery [here](download_instructions.md).
